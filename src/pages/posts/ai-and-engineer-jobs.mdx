Every few days an engineer at work will make a joke about AI replacing Software Engineering jobs. Usually it provokes a bit of laughter and the conversation moves on but it happens often enough to show that it is on people's minds. I cannot predict how your job will be disrupted by AI but one of the perks of being in my second career is that I know that this sort of existential crisis is not unique to tech.

My previous career was in oil and gas; that industry swings like a pendulum between boom and bust. It's also based on finite resources so everyone knows that one day it will cease to exist in its current form. This leads to stress about younger people entering the industry and I've heard that it's getting harder and harder to attract new talent.

Before I left, I didn't know whether I was going to be able to squeeze in a whole career before the music stopped. The problem is that those worries are so far out of our control that there is very little point in stressing about them. What you can control is your approach to work and that can set you up well to adapt to change.

[John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack) posted the below exchange with a person concerned about a future career in software engineering given recent AI advancements. You can read the exchange [here](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520) but i've pulled out the key quote below:

  <blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1637087219591659520">
    Software is just a tool to help accomplish something for people - many
    programmers never understood that. Keep your eyes on the delivered value,
    and don't over focus on the specifics of the tools.
  </blockquote>

The funny thing is that this advice stands for other types of engineering and even without the existential threat. The best engineers I have worked with (in the oilfield and in software) already do this. It helps to be interested in your tools to get the best out of them but should be ready to drop them when something better comes along.
