It's hard to slow down and think.

It's easy to pick up a new task, open your editor and start writing code. Sometimes this approach pays off and I fly through the task. Other times complexity catches me out; I choose an inefficient approach, I don't see the solid and simple solution. I often get there in the end after various iterations or a self-review but I still missed the opportunity to get it on the first swing.

When this happens there are two resources I always return to. Ben Kuhn's [Think Real Hard](https://www.benkuhn.net/thinkrealhard/) reflects on the joke about Richard Feynman's algorithm for problems solving:

1. Write down the problem.
2. Think real hard.
3. Write down the solution.

Kuhn makes the point that while it is a joke meant to capture Feynman's genius; there is a nugget in there for us mortals. He asserts that while there are some tricks to becoming a better programmer, most progress comes from thinking really hard.

Rich Hickey's [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) asserts that your ability to solve difficult technical problems increases with the amount of time spent thinking about those problems.

I lack a hammock in my life but I've been experimenting with building more thinking time into my task strategy. In practice, this looks like this:

1. Gather the information I need: read the specification, poke around the existing code and gain context.
2. Use the [Sit](https://sit.sonnet.io/) app to black out my laptop screen for 5 minutes. Focus and think about the problem. Start breaking the problem down into pieces.
3. Write a first pass at a list of sub-tasks.
4. Start the first sub-task.

If you can, sub out step 2 for a walk outside or a lie down in your hammock but even just blocking distractions and thinking for 5 minutes work well.

If progress slows then I repeat step 2. I find that I often get to the end of the 5 minutes and I'm ready to start the next sub-task. I also find that I'm more likely to spot a simpler solution or a more efficient approach.
